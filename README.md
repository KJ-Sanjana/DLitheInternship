I have done my project on K Nearest Neighbors 
Dataset used for my project is Iris.csv

Iris dataset consists of 3 types i.e,Setosa,virginica,versicolor
All these vary with sepal length,sepal with,petal lenth,petal width
x=sepal length,sepal with,petal lenth,petal width
y=Class
Majority of data is gone foe traning set i.e, 0.80 rest of it is going for testing
saclar.fit is used to train x axis
Transform x_train and x_test data
Fit classifier data x_train,y_train
To predict the algorithm predicted value
Confusion matrix 
out of 9 setosa which were gone for prediction 9 were predicted(100% accuracy) 
out of 9 versicolor 9 are were gone for prediction 9 were predicted(100% accuracy)
out of 10 virginica 2 were predicted as versicolor(80% accuracy)
